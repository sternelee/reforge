# Create Agents

Create and manage agents for the code-forge application. Agents are specialized AI assistants with specific capabilities, tools, and behaviors.

## File Location

**CRITICAL**: All agent files must be created in the `<cwd>/.forge/agents` directory, where `<cwd>` is the current working directory of your code-forge project.

- **Directory**: `<cwd>/.forge/agents`
- **File format**: `{agent-id}.md`
- **Example**: If your project is at `/home/user/my-project`, agents go in `/home/user/my-project/.forge/agents/`

This is the only location where forge will discover and load custom agents.

## Agent File Structure

Every agent file must have:

1. **YAML Frontmatter** (required):
   - `id`: Unique agent identifier
   - `title`: Agent display name
   - `description`: Detailed description of what the agent does
   - `reasoning`: Configuration with `enabled: true/false`
   - `tools`: List of tools the agent can use
   - `user_prompt`: Template for user context

2. **Agent Body** (required):
   - Agent identity and purpose
   - Core principles
   - Capabilities
   - Methodology
   - Best practices
   - Limitations and boundaries

### Example Agent File

```markdown
---
id: "forge"
title: "Perform technical development tasks"
description: "Hands-on implementation agent that executes software development tasks..."
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - sem_search
  - sage
  - fs_search
  - read
  - write
  - undo
  - remove
  - patch
  - shell
  - fetch
  - skill
  - mcp_*
user_prompt: |-
  <{{event.name}}>{{event.value}}</{{event.name}}>
  <system_date>{{current_date}}</system_date>
---

```

## Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Determine Agent Purpose

Identify what the agent should accomplish:
- What is the agent's primary function?
- What tasks will it perform?
- What tools does it need?
- What are its limitations?
- How does it differ from existing agents?

### Step 2: Choose Agent ID and Title

Use descriptive IDs and titles:
- ID: Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `test-automation`)
- Title: Use clear, descriptive text (e.g., "Review code quality", "Automate testing")

### Step 3: Write the Agent File

Create the file in the `<cwd>/.forge/agents` directory with the format: `{agent-id}.md`

**IMPORTANT**: The file MUST be in `<cwd>/.forge/agents` where `<cwd>` is your current working directory. Agents placed anywhere else will not be discovered by forge.

#### Frontmatter

```yaml
---
id: "your-agent-id"
title: "Your Agent Title"
description: "Detailed description of what this agent does, its capabilities, and when to use it."
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - tool1
  - tool2
  - tool3
user_prompt: |-
  <{{event.name}}>{{event.value}}</{{event.name}}>
  <system_date>{{current_date}}</system_date>
---
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Identity

- Start with a clear introduction: "You are [Agent Name], a [type] assistant..."
- Describe the agent's primary function
- Be specific about the agent's purpose and scope

### Core Principles

- Include 5-7 core principles
- Use numbered lists for clarity
- Each principle should be concise and actionable
- Cover key aspects like tone, approach, and behavior

### Capabilities

- Organize capabilities by category with subheadings
- Use bullet points for individual capabilities
- Be specific about what the agent can do
- Include both high-level and detailed capabilities

### Methodology

- Provide a step-by-step approach
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Include subheadings for major phases
- Be clear about the process the agent follows

### Limitations

- Clearly state what the agent cannot do
- Explain the reasoning behind limitations
- Provide alternatives or suggestions when appropriate
- Use a dedicated section for boundaries

### Tool Selection

- Only include tools the agent actually needs
- Consider the agent's purpose when selecting tools
- Use wildcards for groups of related tools (e.g., `mcp_*`)
- Order tools logically (core tools first, then specialized tools)

## Common Patterns

### File Reference Format

When agents reference code, use this format:
- `filepath:startLine-endLine` for ranges
- `filepath:startLine` for single lines

Example: `src/cli.rs:305-322`

### Agent Handoff

When an agent cannot perform a task, suggest an alternative:

```markdown
## Agent Transition:

If at any point the user requests [task], explicitly state that you cannot perform such tasks and offer to switch to a different agent (like [Agent Name]) that is authorized to perform those tasks.
```

### Response Structure

Organize agent responses with clear sections:
- Summary or overview
- Detailed findings or analysis
- Technical details
- Insights and context
- Follow-up suggestions or next steps

title: "My Agent"
description: "Agent description"
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - sem_search
  - read
---
```
(Missing `user_prompt`)

Good: **Correct**:

```markdown
---
id: "my-agent"
title: "My Agent"
description: "Agent description"
reasoning:
  enabled: true
tools:
  - sem_search
  - read
user_prompt: |-
  <{{event.name}}>{{event.value}}</{{event.name}}>

```markdown
---
id: "my_agent"
```

Good: **Correct**:

```markdown
---
id: "my-agent"
```

### Description Mistakes

```markdown
---
description: "This agent does things"
```

Good: **Correct**:

```markdown
---
description: "Hands-on implementation agent that executes software development tasks through direct code modifications, file operations, and system commands. Specializes in building features, fixing bugs, refactoring code, and making concrete changes to codebases."
```

   ```bash
   # If you have yamllint installed
   yamllint path/to/your-agent.md
   ```

2. **Manual Review**: Read through the agent
   - Does the introduction clearly state the agent's purpose?
   - Are core principles well-defined?
   - Are capabilities appropriate for the agent's purpose?
   - Are limitations clearly stated?

3. **Tool Verification**: Check tools
   - Are all tools appropriate for the agent's purpose?
   - Are any essential tools missing?
   - Are there unnecessary tools?

4. **Content Review**: Verify agent body
   - Is the agent identity clear?
   - Are instructions specific and actionable?
   - Is the methodology well-defined?
   - Are limitations explained?

5. **Comparison**: Compare with existing agents
   - How does it differ from similar agents?
   - Is there overlap in capabilities?
   - Is the agent's niche clear?

## Verification

After creating an agent:
1. **Verify the file location**: Ensure the file is in `<cwd>/.forge/agents` directory (CRITICAL - agents anywhere else will not be found)
2. Check YAML frontmatter is valid (use `---` delimiters)
3. Ensure the agent ID matches the filename (without .md)
4. Verify all required fields are present (id, title, description, reasoning, tools, user_prompt)
5. Check tools are appropriate for the agent's purpose
6. Verify agent body includes introduction, principles, capabilities, methodology, and limitations
7. Test the agent can be loaded successfully
