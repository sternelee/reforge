  ## Error Management:

  - Use `anyhow::Result` for error handling in services and repositories.
  - Create domain errors using `thiserror`.
  - Never implement `From` for converting domain errors, manually convert them

  ## Writing Tests:

  - All tests should be written in three discrete steps:

    ```rust
    use pretty_assertions::assert_eq; // Always use pretty assertions

    fn test_foo() {
        let fixture = ...; // Instantiate a fixture for the test
        let actual = ...; // Execute the fixture to create an output
        let expected = ...; // Define a hand written expected result
        assert_eq!(actual, expected); // Assert that the actual result matches the expected result
    }
    ```

  - Use `pretty_assertions` for better error messages.

  - Use fixtures to create test data.

  - Use `assert_eq!` for equality checks.

  - Use `assert!(...)` for boolean checks.

  - Use unwraps in test functions and anyhow::Result in fixtures.

  - Keep the boilerplate to a minimum.

  - Use words like `fixture`, `actual` and `expected` in test functions.

  - Fixtures should be generic and reusable.

  - Test should always be written in the same file as the source code.

  - We use `insta` to run tests:
    ```
    cargo insta test --accept --unreferenced=delete
    ```
  - Use `new`, Default and derive_setters::Setters to create `actual`, `expected` and specially `fixtures`. For eg:
    Good
    User::default().age(12).is_happy(true).name("John")
    User::new("Job").age(12).is_happy()
    User::test() // Special test constructor

    Bad
    Use {name: "John".to_string(), is_happy: true, age: 12}
    User::with_name("Job") // Bad name, should stick to User::new() or User::test()

  - Use unwrap() unless the error information is useful. Use `expect` instead of `panic!` when error message is useful for eg:
    Good
    users.first().expect("List should not be empty")

    Bad
    if let Some(user) = users.first() {
      // ...
    } else {
      panic!("List should not be empty")
    }

  - Prefer using assert_eq on full objects instead of asserting each field
    Good
    assert_eq(actual, expected);

    Bad
    assert_eq(actual.a, expected.a);
    assert_eq(actual.b, expected.b);

  ## Verification:
  1. Run crate specific tests to ensure they pass.
     ```
     cargo insta test --accept --unreferenced=delete
     ```

  2. Lint and format the codebase.
     ```
     cargo +nightly fmt --all && cargo +nightly clippy --fix --allow-staged --allow-dirty --workspace;
     ```

  ## Writing Domain Types:
  - Use `derive_setters` to derive setters and use the `strip_option` and the `into` attributes on the struct types.


  ## Refactoring:
  - If asked to fix failing tests, always confirm whether to update the implementation or the tests.

  ## Elm Architecture (in forge_main_neo):
  - Command executors should ALWAYS return Option<Action>, never send them directly through channels
  - Actions are the only way to update application state
  - State updates trigger UI changes through the unidirectional data flow
  - Commands represent intent to perform side effects
  - Actions represent the result of those side effects
  - The executor pattern: Command -> Side Effect -> Action -> State Update -> UI Update

  ## Git Operations
  - Safely assume git is pre-installed
  - Safely assume github cli (gh) is pre-installed
  - Always use `Co-Authored-By: ForgeCode <noreply@forgecode.dev>` for git commits and Github comments
