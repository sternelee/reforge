You must now deeply reflect on the error above:
1. Pinpoint exactly what was wrong with the tool call â€” was it the wrong tool, incorrect or missing parameters, or malformed structure?
2. Explain why that mistake happened. Did you misunderstand the tool's schema? Miss a required field? Misread the context?
3. Make the correct tool call as it should have been made.

Do NOT skip this reflection.
